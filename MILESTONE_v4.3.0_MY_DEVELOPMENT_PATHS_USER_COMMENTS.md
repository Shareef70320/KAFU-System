# MILESTONE v4.3.0 - My Development Paths (User) + Comments/Attachments

Date: 2025-10-05
Version: v4.3.0
Status: COMPLETE

## What’s included

- User menu: My Development Paths (single canonical entry; removed duplicate "My Development").
- User full-page Path Details: `/user/my-development-paths/:id`.
- Per-intervention comments with optional attachments for users.
- Backend endpoints for listing/adding intervention comments.

## Backend

- File: `backend/routes/developmentPaths.js`
  - Fixed user assignments endpoint to use `sid`.
  - Added comments endpoints:
    - GET `/api/development-paths/interventions/:iid/comments`
    - POST `/api/development-paths/interventions/:iid/comments` (multipart: `author_sid`, optional `comment`, `attachment`)
  - Attachment storage: `backend/uploads` (served from `/uploads`).
- DB: created table `path_intervention_comments` with FK to `path_interventions` and `employees(sid)`.

## Frontend

- New pages:
  - `frontend/src/pages/user/MyDevelopmentPaths.js` (list assigned paths)
  - `frontend/src/pages/user/PathDetailsUser.js` (full page details, comments UI)
  - Routes in `App.js`:
    - `/user/my-development-paths`
    - `/user/my-development-paths/:id`
- Sidebar (`components/Layout.js`): kept only “My Development Paths”.

## How to use

1) User → My Development Paths → View Details.
2) In each intervention card: Add Comment / attach file → Post.

## Validation

- Manual curl test confirms POST comments works and persists.
- File attachments saved to `/uploads` and accessible via link.

## Notes

- Admin/Manager visibility for these comments will be added next.
