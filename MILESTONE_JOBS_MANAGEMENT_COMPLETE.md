└── App.js               # Routing configuration
```

### Backend Structure
```
backend/routes/
└── jobs.js              # Jobs API routes

backend/prisma/
└── schema.prisma        # Database schema with Job model
```

### Key Components

- **Search System**: Debounced search across all job fields
- **Statistics**: Fixed counts not affected by filters
- **Edit Form**: Comprehensive job editing with all fields
- **Responsive Layout**: Mobile-friendly design

## 🚀 Performance Optimizations

1. **Debounced Search**: 500ms delay prevents excessive API calls
2. **Memoized Components**: React.useMemo for expensive calculations
3. **Query Caching**: TanStack Query for efficient data management
4. **Pagination**: Handles large datasets efficiently
5. **Raw SQL Queries**: Optimized database queries for better performance

## 🔗 Integration Points

### Employee Management Integration
- **Shared Location Data**: Both pages use identical location lists
- **Consistent UI**: Same design patterns and components
- **Unified Experience**: Seamless navigation between pages

### Database Integration
