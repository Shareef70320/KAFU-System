# üéØ MILESTONE: Job-Profile Mapping System Complete

**Version:** `v1.2-job-profile-mapping-complete`  
**Date:** December 2024  
**Status:** ‚úÖ COMPLETE & STABLE

## üöÄ Overview

This milestone represents a major evolution of the competency mapping system, transforming it from individual job-competency pairs to a more logical **job-profile** approach where each job has a single profile containing multiple competencies with different levels.

## ‚ú® Key Features Implemented

### 1. **Job-Profile System**
- **One Job = One Profile**: Each job now has a single profile card
- **Multiple Competencies**: One job can have multiple competencies with different levels
- **Grouped Display**: All competencies for a job are shown in one organized card
- **Example**: Quality Inspector ‚Üí 5 competencies (Tendering BASIC, Business Performance INTERMEDIATE, etc.) in one card

### 2. **Enhanced Job Competency Mapping Page** (`/job-competency-mapping`)
- **Job Profile Cards**: Clean, organized display of job profiles
- **Competency Grid**: Competencies displayed in organized grid within each card
- **Level Badges**: Color-coded level indicators (Basic, Intermediate, Advanced, Mastery)
- **Individual Management**: Remove specific competencies from job profiles
- **Statistics Dashboard**: Updated stats showing job profiles, total mappings, etc.
- **Search & Filter**: Enhanced filtering by job, competency, and level

### 3. **Redesigned Add Mapping Page** (`/add-mapping`)
- **3-Column Layout**:
  - **Left Column**: Job selection with search and filters
  - **Middle Column**: Competency selection with level dropdown
  - **Right Column**: Live preview of job profile being created
- **Interactive Workflow**: Select job ‚Üí Add competencies ‚Üí Preview ‚Üí Create

- **Live Preview**: Real-time preview of the job profile as you build it
- **Bulk Creation**: Create all mappings at once when profile is complete

### 4. **UI/UX Improvements**
- **Better Organization**: Logical grouping and visual hierarchy
- **Color Coding**: Consistent color scheme for levels and families
- **Responsive Design**: Works well on all screen sizes
- **Intuitive Workflow**: Much more user-friendly than individual mappings
- **Visual Feedback**: Clear indicators for selected items and actions

- **API Integration**: Maintains existing API structure
- **State Management**: Enhanced state management for job profiles
- **Component Updates**: Updated UI components for better display

### Data Structure
- **Job Profiles**: Grouped by job ID with array of competencies
- **Competency Objects**: Include competency details and required level
- **Level Management**: Proper handling of competency levels
- **Filtering Logic**: Enhanced filtering for job profiles

## üìä System Capabilities

### Current Working Features

2. **View** all job profiles in organized cards
3. **Search/Filter** to find specific profiles
4. **Remove** individual competencies as needed
5. **Edit** job profiles (future feature)

## üîÑ Version Control

### Git Tags
