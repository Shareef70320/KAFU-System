# KAFU System Milestone v4.6.0 - Stable Release

**Date:** October 14, 2025  
**Status:** âœ… STABLE - Most reliable version to date  
**Database Backup:** `backup_v4.6.0_stable.sql`

## ðŸŽ¯ Overview

This milestone captures the most stable state of the system to date, incorporating assessment system fixes, Question Bank bulk delete reliability, and global job-based competency visibility.

## âœ… Key Updates Since v4.5.0

- Enforced job-based competency visibility across API and frontend:
  - Backend `GET /api/user-assessments/competencies` now returns only competencies mapped via `job_competencies` for the requesting userâ€™s job (no global fallback).
  - Frontend `MyCompetencies` filters competencies to those mapped to user's job.
- Cleaned up historical assessment session data for targeted users to avoid conflicts.
- Question Bank header cleanup: removed duplicate Delete buttons; kept only under filters.
- Bulk delete endpoint hardened with parameterized queries and enum casts.

## ðŸ§© Components Covered

- Assessment System (start/submit, sessions, responses, scoring, levels)
- Question Bank (CRUD, CSV import, bulk delete)
- Job Competency Profiles (view/edit, duplication prevention)
- Assessor Management (bulk assignment, per-competency edit/delete)
- User My Competencies (job-mapped visibility)

## ðŸ”§ Technical Notes

- Backend: `backend/routes/userAssessments.js`
  - Enforce job-mapped competencies; remove global fallback list.
  - Consistent column quoting for camelCase and snake_case columns.
- Backend: `backend/routes/questions.js`
  - Parameterized queries for bulk delete; `::"QuestionType"` cast for enum.
- Frontend: `frontend/src/pages/user/MyCompetencies.js`
  - Fetch jobs and job_competencies to filter competencies list for the current user.
