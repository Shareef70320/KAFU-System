# MILESTONE v4.4.0 – Intervention ↔ Competency Linking + Path UI Polish

Date: 2025-10-05
Version: v4.4.0
Status: COMPLETE

## Scope
- Link Learning Interventions to Competencies and display them in Path Details.
- Visual polish to Admin and User Path Details pages.

## Backend
- File: backend/routes/developmentPaths.js
  - Added endpoints:
    - GET /api/development-paths/interventions/:iid/competencies
    - PUT /api/development-paths/interventions/:iid/competencies (replace all links)
- DB: Created table

```
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS path_intervention_competencies (
  intervention_id text REFERENCES path_interventions(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  competency_id text REFERENCES competencies(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  PRIMARY KEY (intervention_id, competency_id)
);
```

## Frontend
- Admin Path Details (frontend/src/pages/PathDetails.js)
  - Create Intervention: multi-select “Link Competencies” (saved after create)
  - Each intervention shows linked competencies as chips
  - Header and timeline styling upgrades
- User Path Details (frontend/src/pages/user/PathDetailsUser.js)
  - Header/card polish for dates and duration chips
- Admin Paths and User My Development Paths cards polished (gradients, chips)

## How to Use
1) Admin → Development Paths → Details → Interventions → Add Intervention.
2) Select competencies in “Link Competencies” and add.
3) Chips appear under the intervention.

## Next Steps
- Edit modal: multi-select to update linked competencies.
- Show competency chips on the user details page as well.
