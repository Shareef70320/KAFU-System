# MILESTONE v3.1.0 - Assessment Level Management System

**Date:** December 2024  
**Version:** 3.1.0  
**Focus:** Complete Assessment Level Management with Visual Feedback

## 🎯 **Milestone Overview**

This milestone completes the assessment system with comprehensive level management, visual feedback, and status tracking across all user interfaces. The system now provides a seamless workflow where users and managers can set competency levels with proper persistence and visual indicators.

## ✨ **Key Features Implemented**

### **1. User Level Management**
- **One-Time Selection**: User-confirmed levels persist per competency (not per attempt)
- **Visual Feedback**: Hover effects, scale animations, and smooth transitions on level selection buttons
- **Data Persistence**: Levels are saved across all assessment sessions for the same competency
- **Automatic Refresh**: Competency data refreshes after level confirmations

### **2. Manager Level Management**
- **Per-Competency Setting**: Managers set level once per competency for each employee
- **Visual Indicators**: Green highlighting when level is selected, "✓ Saved" confirmation
- **Success Feedback**: Toast notifications when levels are saved successfully
- **Persistent Storage**: Manager levels apply to all attempts for that competency

### **3. Competency Status Display**
- **My Competencies Page**: Shows user-confirmed and manager-selected levels
- **Assessment Dashboard**: Displays all three levels (system, user, manager) when available
- **Status Cards**: Dedicated sections showing complete competency status
- **Color-Coded Levels**: Visual distinction between different level types

### **4. Enhanced User Experience**
- **Smooth Animations**: Transition effects on interactive elements
- **Clear Feedback**: Visual and toast notifications for all actions
- **Data Consistency**: Automatic synchronization across all interfaces
- **Error Handling**: Graceful error handling with user-friendly messages

## 🔧 **Technical Implementation**

### **Backend Changes**
- **Level Persistence**: Modified `/user-assessments/confirm-level` to save per competency
- **Manager Endpoint**: Enhanced `/manager/confirm-level-by-competency` for one-time setting
- **Data Enrichment**: Added `userConfirmedLevel` and `managerSelectedLevel` to competencies API
- **History Tracking**: Updated assessment history to include all level types

### **Frontend Changes**
- **UserAssessments.js**: Added visual feedback and data refresh after level confirmation
- **MyCompetencies.js**: Added competency status display with all level types
- **TeamEmployees.js**: Enhanced manager level selection with visual feedback and toast notifications
- **UI Components**: Improved button styling, hover effects, and transition animations

### **Database Schema**
- **Assessment Sessions**: Enhanced with `user_confirmed_level` and `manager_selected_level` columns
- **Level Persistence**: Levels stored per user-competency combination
- **Data Integrity**: Proper foreign key relationships and constraints

## 📊 **System Workflow**

### **Complete Assessment Process**
1. **User takes assessment** → **completes questions** → **views results**
2. **User confirms level** → **level saved per competency** → **data refreshed**
3. **Manager views team** → **sets level per competency** → **level applies to all attempts**
4. **Status tracking** → **all levels displayed** → **complete competency picture**

### **Level Management Flow**
```
Assessment Result → User Confirmation → Manager Review → Final Status
     ↓                    ↓                    ↓              ↓
System Level → User Level → Manager Level → Complete Status
```
